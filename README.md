Storytelling with Data

# Portfolio Data Science & Analytics

Welcome ! 

I am Awa, passionate with Data. 

In my opinion, Data Analytics is like a puzzle. 
I am all the time fascinated with all the information we can get from just some simple code. 

5 years ago, I didn't even know about Data Analytics nor Data Science. I was in my bubble. 
Then, Curiosity led me to the Universe of Data. 
And I finally found my Element, my true passion.

My ultimate goal is to master it, work on projects interesting and MEANINGFUL to me and people. 

I do believe that Data is what hold us together.
It never dies. 
It never lies.
It's everywhere.

Here are my personal projects👩🏽‍💻.
